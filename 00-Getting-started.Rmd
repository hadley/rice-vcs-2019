## R notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Crtl+Shift+Enter* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac). 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert* button on the toolbar, then selecting *R* or by pressing  *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Windows) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).

To render a complete copy of the document click the *Knit* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+K* (Mac). This runs all code in a separate R session, ensuring that your results are reproducible.
